            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that combines layers of rich pasta, savory meat or vegetables, and creamy béchamel sauce, all topped with melted cheese for a comforting, 
            hearty meal. Each layer is carefully constructed to create a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, from the tender pasta to the rich tomato sauce. Whether made with ground 
            beef, sausage, or a mix of fresh vegetables, lasagna is a dish that brings people together around the table.
