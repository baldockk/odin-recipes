        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Spaghetti Bolognese is a beloved Italian classic, featuring a rich, savory meat sauce served over perfectly cooked spaghetti. The sauce, known as "ragù alla Bolognese," 
                is made by simmering ground beef or pork with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and a blend of aromatic herbs and spices. This slow-cooked mixture develops deep flavors that coat 
                every strand of pasta, creating a satisfying and comforting dish that's perfect for any occasion.

                Whether enjoyed as a family dinner or served to guests, Spaghetti Bolognese is a timeless favorite. With its hearty meat sauce, tender spaghetti, and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese
                 on top, it’s a delicious, filling meal that brings people together with every bite.
